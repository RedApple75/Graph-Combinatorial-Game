# Graph-Combinatorial-Game
The Graph Removal Game is a two-player combinatorial game on an undirected graph. Each turn, a player removes one node and all its adjacent nodes. The player unable to move loses. This project models the game using Python and NetworkX, computes Grundy numbers, and visualizes winning positions to study game strategies and graph structures.
